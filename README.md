# TODO

- more generous hit test.  whole column/region.  not just margin area
- shelve swiping selection for now (come back to it later, use second core to handle touch/display concurrently)
- update readme
- check licensing
- come up with matrix mapping

- use model view view-model
- fix bug: making selection smaller, making selection opposite direction from start
- split out drivers
- investigate CAD
- why is it slow?
- just generally optimize
- more CI
- more tests
- propagate errors
- making sure only part of the screen is being updated
