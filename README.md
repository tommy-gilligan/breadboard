# TODO

- bring in embedded
- remove config params eg. margin.  simplifies code for now.
- more generous hit test.  whole column/region.  not just margin area
- shelve swiping selection for now (come back to it later, use second core to handle touch/display concurrently)
- update readme
- check licensing
- come up with matrix mapping

- use model view view-model
- fix bug: making selection smaller, making selection opposite direction from start
- split out drivers
- investigate CAD
- why is it slow?
- just generally optimize
